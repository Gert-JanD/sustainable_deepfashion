## Number of samples per category

The dataset contains different categories of clothing like short sleeve top, trousers, skirt, vest etc. We first take a look at the amount of images for every other category, as we will currently focus on one category for the project.

As can be seen on the picture, category id 1 (short sleeve tops) contains the most images. This is the one we will use in training and in the further analysis of the dataset.
